iOS Developer Nanodegreee Project 1

## Project Overview
An iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

### Concepts Learned
- Creating a new project from existing iOS app templates
- Adding buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard
- Leveraging the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView
- Creating Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code
- Navigating between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController
- Playing audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class
- Running the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device
- Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code
